%% Tasks

%% A. Using methods based on statistical data (like, for instance, the
%% ones presented in Ref. [1]), make a first vehicle level estimation
%% of the spacecraft dry mass, power, size, reliability and
%% cost. Hint: you can use the reference spacecrafts characteristics
%% found in the framework of WP 1.2 to evaluate the accuracy of the
%% methods you have adopted, or even to develop your own estimation
%% method.

%% B. Preliminarily define the orbital parameters (a, e, i, , ) and
%% the interplanetary transfer trajectory foreseen for your mission.

%% C. Estimate the total v required by the mission and, based on
%% this, the total propellant mass needed (note: this value depends on
%% the type of engines/thrusters you use!! If this has not been
%% decided yet in detail, you may still have several open options for
%% the propellant mass at this stage…). Include in your estimation all
%% the relevant mission phases (e.g. launch, transfer, orbit
%% corrections, station keeping, interplanetary transfer, etc.). Don’t
%% forget to take into account proper margins!! Hint: you can use the
%% data referred to similar missions, found in the framework of WP
%% 1.1, as a baseline for your estimation.

%% D. Choose an adequate launcher for your mission and, consequently,
%% indicate the launch location, sketch the ascent profile, estimate
%% the maximum launch loads and the required minimum longitudinal and
%% transversal natural frequencies, and identify the payload adapters
%% available for use and their characteristics.

%% E. Based on the information obtained from the previous Tasks,
%% generate a detailed mission profile and a rough timeline for the
%% mission.

\deliverable{1.3.1 Vehicle-Level Estimation}

In this section some vehicle-level estimations of the spacecraft are
given in order to identify the most important design parameters.

\subsection{Dry mass}
\label{sec:drymass}

For the vehicle dry mass estimation, some reference spacecrafts were
used. The dry mass of the reference spacecrafts was plotted against
the payload in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Payload-vs-DryMass}
  \caption{Payload vs. Dry Mass}
\end{figure}

The data shown in the figure above was used to estimate the dry mass
of the satelite to be designed, which was found to be \SI{1100}{kg}.

\subsection{Power}
\label{sec:power}

From the reference data it can be seen that the typical used power is
between \SI{400}{W} and \SI{636}{W} with a payload of
\SI{105}{kg}. With the used payload in mind, the estimated range is
between \SI{305}{W} and \SI{485}{W}.

\subsection{Reliability}

The required mission reliability has to be higher than 0.9. From this
requirement the failure rate $\lambda$ can be determined.

\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \frac{\ln R}{t}
\end{equation}

This leads to a failure rate of 0.01317 failures per year for a
lifespan of 6.2 years.

\subsection{Initial mass}
\label{sec:initialmass}

To calculate the total mass of the spacecraft, Tsiolkovsky's rocket
equation is used

\begin{equation}
  \Delta V = V_e \ln \frac{M_0}{M_1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  M_0 = M_1 \exp \frac{\Delta V}{V_e}
\end{equation}

The $\Delta V$ has been calculated in a previous part and is found to
be \SI{2.625}{km/s}. The exhaust velocity is determined by the
specific impulse multiplied with the gravitational acceleration of
Earth. An estimated $I_{\mathrm{sp}}$ of \SI{318}{s} is used, leading to an
exhaust velocity of \SI{3117}{m/s}. Finally, an initial mass of
\SI{2550}{kg} is found. Since the calculation assumes ideal conditions
an additional margin of \SI{20}{\%} is used, leading to an estimation
of \SI{3000}{kg} for the initial mass of the spacecraft.

\subsection{Sizing}

In order to estimate the size of the spacecraft, an average mass
density of \SI{79}{kg/m^3} is used as this value was indicated in
\textit{Space Mission Engineering: The New SMAD}
\cite{Wertz2011SpaceMissionEng}. Using the following relation,

\begin{equation}
  V = \frac{M}{\rho}
\end{equation}
an estimated size of \SI{38}{m^3} is determined.

\subsection{Cost}

The cost of the spacecraft can be estimated upon the dry mass using
the following relationship\cite{ae1201reader},

\begin{equation}
  C_{\mathrm{S/C}} = 0.3531 (M_{\mathrm{dry}})^{0.839}
\end{equation}
resulting in a spacecft cost of 125.8 million dollars.

  \begin{equation}

  & One full orbit around Jupiter was assumed as a preparation time
  for the departure towards Europa orbit.  This is simply calculated
  as if the spacecraft is circulating in Europa's orbit, which has
  the radius of \SI{671000}{km} from Jupiter.

  \[ \begin{aligned}
    T_{\mathrm{orbit}}
    &= 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{\mu_{\mathrm{jupiter}}}} \\
    &= 2\pi\sqrt{\frac
      {(\SI{671000}{km})^3}

    &= 3.6\,\mathrm{days}
  \end{aligned} \] \\ \midrule

  2 days

  & The target orbit around Europa has a much smaller radius of
  \SI{1760}{km} compared to the radius of Europa's orbit around
  Jupiter (\SI{671000}{km}).  Under the assumption that the Europa
  orbit insertion is done from one point of the Jovian orbit to the
  right opposite side of the orbit, the transfer time can be
  approximated as half the orbit period of Europa around Jupiter which
  would be around 2 days. \\

%% D1.3.5. Estimated total v required by the mission, including a
%% table showing its breakdown into all the contributions related to
%% different mission phases and operations.

\deliverable{1.3.5 Estimated delta-V Budget}

The most traditional interplanetary transfer, the direct Hohmann
transfer orbit can be considered for this mission, since this method
has high efficiency, rapid transfer, and low radiation
exposure.\cite{Wertz2011SpaceMissionEng}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Hohmann-Orbit}
  \caption{Interplanetary Hohmann-Transfer-Orbit to Jupiter}
\end{figure}

To simplify the calculations it is assumed that both, Earth and
Jupiter, orbit the Sun in a perfectly circular orbit.  The required
orbital parameters are taken from the previous section.  Using
Hohmann-Transfer-Orbits we obtain

\begin{align*}
  \Delta V_{total} = {} &
  \Delta V_{\mathrm{perihelion}}
  + \Delta V_{\mathrm{apohelion}} \\
  = {} & \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{sun}}}{r_{\mathrm{earth}}}}
  - \sqrt{\mu_{\mathrm{sun}} \left(\frac{2}{r_{\mathrm{earth}}}
    - \frac{1}{a_{\mathrm{transfer}}}\right)} \\
  + & \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{sun}}}{r_{\mathrm{jupiter}}}}
  - \sqrt{\mu_{\mathrm{sun}}\left(\frac{2}{r_{\mathrm{jupiter}}}
    - \frac{1}{a_{\mathrm{transfer}}}\right)} \\
  \approx {} & \SI{8.78}{km/s} + \SI{5.63}{km/s} = \SI{14.41}{km/s} \\
\end{align*}

Given that $\Delta V_\mathrm{perihelion}$ (\SI{8.78}{km/s}) is
achieved by the launcher rocket, the total $\Delta V$ that the
spacecraft has to carry itself is \SI{5.63}{km/s} which is still
rather high compared to similar existing missions, such as Juno or
JUICE (See WP1.1 for details).  Thus, it can be concluded that the
Hohmann interplanetary transfer orbit in this case does not give the
most practical/optimum trajectory for the mission.  One of the
solutions to reduce the high $\Delta V$ is to use gravity assist,
which basically makes use of the gravity of other planets during the
flyby to induce a “slingshot” effect.  Two of the existing reference
missions to Jupiter use such method to arrive at the planet Jupiter’s
orbit; Galileo and Juno.  As discussed in WP 1.1, Galileo has gravity
assist of Venus-Earth-Earth, and Juno has gravity assist of Earth.
Compared to Galileo, the Juno spacecraft took almost 14 month less
time to get to Jupiter.\cite{nasagalileo} Considering the fact that
the Juno mission shares many similar aspects with our own mission to
Europa, the mission profile of Juno can be considered as a model for
our mission.  Using one gravity assist of Earth, the orbit transfer
trajectory can be designed as shown in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Transfer-Orbits}
  \caption{Orbit transfer trajectory using one Earth gravity assist}
\end{figure}

It should be noted that the spacecraft may temporarily orbit around
the Jupiter several times in order to achieve Europa Orbit insertion
in a favorable time and position, preferably with the minimum
$\Delta V$ and thus, the least fuel consumption. Using the data from
the Juno mission, the total $\Delta V$ budget can be estimated
\cite{DMullerNet} ($\Delta V$ for the Europa orbit insertion was taken
from the other source since the Juno mission is mainly orbiting the
planet Jupiter rather than its moon
Europa). \cite{sweetser1997trajectory}

\begin{table}[H]
  \caption{$\Delta V$ Breakdown}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  Maneuver & $\Delta V$ \si{km/s} \\

  Deep space maneuver after launch until arrival at Jupiter & 733 \\

  Jupiter orbit insertion and period adjustment & 1072 \\

  Europa orbit insertion & 720 \\

  Possible orbit correction maneuver ($\Delta V$ margin) & 100 \\

  Total $\Delta V$ for spacecraft & 2625 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Therefore, assuming the specific impulse of \SI{318}{s} (bipropellant
system with nitrogen tetroxide/monomethylhydrazine propellants which
is the propulsion system used for Galileo --- additional remark: a
bipropellant system is also used for the Juno and the JUICE
mission)\cite{Ampac}, the required propellant mass for the spacecraft
can be calculated from the rocket equation:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta V = V_e \ln \frac{M_0}{M_1}
  = I_{\mathrm{sp}} \, g_0 \ln \frac{M_0}{M_1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  M_{\mathrm{propellant}}
  = M_1 \left( \exp \frac{\Delta V}{I_{\mathrm{sp}} \, g_0} - 1 \right)
    \approx 1.223 M_1
\end{equation}
