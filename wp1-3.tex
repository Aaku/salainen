%% Tasks

%% A. Using methods based on statistical data (like, for instance, the
%% ones presented in Ref. [1]), make a first vehicle level estimation
%% of the spacecraft dry mass, power, size, reliability and
%% cost. Hint: you can use the reference spacecrafts characteristics
%% found in the framework of WP 1.2 to evaluate the accuracy of the
%% methods you have adopted, or even to develop your own estimation
%% method.

%% B. Preliminarily define the orbital parameters (a, e, i, , ) and
%% the interplanetary transfer trajectory foreseen for your mission.

\task{B}

\cite{sweetser1997trajectory}

%% C. Estimate the total v required by the mission and, based on
%% this, the total propellant mass needed (note: this value depends on
%% the type of engines/thrusters you use!! If this has not been
%% decided yet in detail, you may still have several open options for
%% the propellant mass at this stage…). Include in your estimation all
%% the relevant mission phases (e.g. launch, transfer, orbit
%% corrections, station keeping, interplanetary transfer, etc.). Don’t
%% forget to take into account proper margins!! Hint: you can use the
%% data referred to similar missions, found in the framework of WP
%% 1.1, as a baseline for your estimation.

%% D. Choose an adequate launcher for your mission and, consequently,
%% indicate the launch location, sketch the ascent profile, estimate
%% the maximum launch loads and the required minimum longitudinal and
%% transversal natural frequencies, and identify the payload adapters
%% available for use and their characteristics.

%% E. Based on the information obtained from the previous Tasks,
%% generate a detailed mission profile and a rough timeline for the
%% mission.
