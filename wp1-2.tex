%% Tasks

%% A. Familiarize with the celestial body object of the mission (Moon,
%% Mars or Europa) and collect all the relevant information on it
%% (e.g., gravitation coefficient, radius, atmospheric density,
%% orbital period, eclipse periods, solar intensity received, albedo,
%% etc.).

%% B. Search for at least 5 existing (or planned) spacecrafts to be
%% used as a reference for your design, i.e.  for which the S/C
%% specifications and characteristics are similar to the ones expected
%% in your mission.  Collect information on the design of the
%% identified reference spacecrafts (e.g., mass and power budgets,
%% size, structure configuration, payload characteristics, orbital
%% parameters, etc.).

%% C. List a detailed set of requirements for your design, taking into
%% account the top-level mission requirements (from the project
%% description provided in Section 3) and the characteristics of the
%% identified reference spacecrafts. Remember: the requirements shall
%% be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic,
%% Time-bound)!! Whereas possible express them as numbers, preferably
%% in the form of a range of values.

%% D. From the complete list of requirements, identify at least 10
%% driving requirements for your design, i.e.  requirements that will
%% play a major role in the design process. Provide an adequate
%% justification for your choice.
