%% Tasks

%% A. Familiarize with the celestial body object of the mission (Moon,
%% Mars or Europa) and collect all the relevant information on it
%% (e.g., gravitation coefficient, radius, atmospheric density,
%% orbital period, eclipse periods, solar intensity received, albedo,
%% etc.).

%% B. Search for at least 5 existing (or planned) spacecrafts to be
%% used as a reference for your design, i.e.  for which the S/C
%% specifications and characteristics are similar to the ones expected
%% in your mission.  Collect information on the design of the
%% identified reference spacecrafts (e.g., mass and power budgets,
%% size, structure configuration, payload characteristics, orbital
%% parameters, etc.).

%% C. List a detailed set of requirements for your design, taking into
%% account the top-level mission requirements (from the project
%% description provided in Section 3) and the characteristics of the
%% identified reference spacecrafts. Remember: the requirements shall
%% be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic,
%% Time-bound)!! Whereas possible express them as numbers, preferably
%% in the form of a range of values.

%% D. From the complete list of requirements, identify at least 10
%% driving requirements for your design, i.e.  requirements that will
%% play a major role in the design process. Provide an adequate
%% justification for your choice.

%% D1.2.3. Detailed list of design requirements, with a clear
%% indication of the driving requirements.

\deliverable{1.2.3}

Design Requirements
\begin{itemize}

\item{Propulsion}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{The spacecraft should be able to generate enough thrust in
    order to get in the flight path to Jupiter after being separated
    from the launcher}
  \item{The propulsion should be provided in such a way that direction
    of the flight path can be controlled}
  \item{The spacecraft should be able to provide propulsion which can
    create the desired delta-V in order to achieve interplanetary
    transfer (Earth -- Jupiter \& Jupiter -- Europa)}
  \item{The propulsion should be provided in case of undesired
    de-orbiting}
  \end{itemize}

\item{Power}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{At least 50 watts of power should be provided for the payload
    (spacecraft instruments), which will be gained from the solar
    arrays (during exposure to sunlight) and batteries (during
    eclipse)}
  \end{itemize}

\item{Structural Performance}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{The spacecraft structure should be able to endure the loads
    that are expected to occur during the launch}
  \item{The spacecraft structure should be able to endure the pressure
    difference that is expected to occur during the missions}
  \item{Natural frequency of the spacecraft should be avoided during
    the missions}
  \end{itemize}

\item{Endurance and structural integrity}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{The spacecraft should resist fatigue and environmental
    deterioration at least over 3 years}
  \item{Reliability should be higher than 0.3}
  \end{itemize}

\item{Data Collection}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{The spacecraft payload should be able to fully deploy the
    implemented instruments, such as high-resolution camera, laser
    altimeter, ice-penetrating radar, spectrometers, and thermal
    camera}
  \item{Data should be collected and stored securely in the spacecraft
    until the transmission to the ground station}
  \end{itemize}

\item{Communication}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{Transmission rate should be high enough so that stored data
    can be transmitted properly without being overloaded and/or lost:
    the antenna should have gain that is high enough, and diameter
    that is large enough}
  \end{itemize}

\item{Attitude control and stability}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{The spacecraft should be able to rotate in all 3-axes to
    control its attitude and point to desired direction}
  \end{itemize}

\item{Thermal control}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{The spacecraft needs to have required absorptivity and
    emissivity level to achieve a heat balance at 150-200K}
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Ten driving requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The spacecraft should be able to generate enough thrust in order
  to get on the flight path to Jupiter after being separated from the
  launcher:} This is one of the factors that determine the amount of
  fuel and type of main engine/thruster for the spacecraft.
\item{The propulsion should be provided in such a way that the
  direction of the flight path can be controlled:} This
  (maneuverability)has to be taken into account when considering the
  location of the thruster(s).
\item{The spacecraft should have sufficient propulsion in order to
  provide the desired delta-V necessary to achieve interplanetary
  transfer (Earth -- Jupiter \& Jupiter -- Europa):} This should be
  considered when determining the propellant mass.
\item{At least 50W of power should be provided for the payload
  (spacecraft instruments), which will be delivered by the solar
  arrays during exposure to sunlight and batteries during eclipse:}
  This should be considered when determining the size and type of the
  solar array as well as the batteries.
\item{The spacecraft structure should be able to endure the pressure
  difference that is expected to occur during the mission:} This will
  determine the load-bearing structure of the spacecraft.
\item{Reliability should be higher than 0.9:} The reliability of
  subsystems should be considered and selected accordingly.
\item{The spacecraft payload should be able to fully deploy the
  included instruments, such as the high-resolution camera, laser
  altimeter, ice-penetrating radar, spectrometers, and the thermal
  camera:} This will determine the design of the payload and its
  relative location within the spacecraft.
\item{The transmission rate should be high enough so that stored data
  can be transmitted properly without being overloaded and/or lost:
  the antenna should have gain that is high enough, and diameter that
  is large enough:} This should be considered when determining the
  size and type of the antenna.
\item{The spacecraft should be able to rotate in all 3-axes to control
  its attitude and point to the desired direction:} This has to be
  taken into account when considering the location of the thruster(s).
\item{The spacecraft needs to have a heat balance of 150-200K and
  therefore requires the correct level of absorptivity and
  emissivity:} This should be considered when selecting the outer skin
  of the spacecraft.
