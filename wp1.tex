\subworkpkg{1.2}

%% Tasks

%% A. Familiarize with the celestial body object of the mission (Moon,

%% size, structure configuration, payload characteristics, orbital
%% parameters, etc.).

%% justification for your choice.

\subworkpkg{1.3}

%% Tasks

%% A. Using methods based on statistical data (like, for instance, the
%% ones presented in Ref. [1]), make a first vehicle level estimation
%% of the spacecraft dry mass, power, size, reliability and
%% cost. Hint: you can use the reference spacecrafts characteristics
%% found in the framework of WP 1.2 to evaluate the accuracy of the
%% methods you have adopted, or even to develop your own estimation
%% method.

%% B. Preliminarily define the orbital parameters (a, e, i, , ) and
%% the interplanetary transfer trajectory foreseen for your mission.

%% C. Estimate the total v required by the mission and, based on
%% this, the total propellant mass needed (note: this value depends on
%% the type of engines/thrusters you use!! If this has not been
%% decided yet in detail, you may still have several open options for
%% the propellant mass at this stage…). Include in your estimation all
%% the relevant mission phases (e.g. launch, transfer, orbit
%% corrections, station keeping, interplanetary transfer, etc.). Don’t
%% forget to take into account proper margins!! Hint: you can use the
%% data referred to similar missions, found in the framework of WP
%% 1.1, as a baseline for your estimation.

%% D. Choose an adequate launcher for your mission and, consequently,
%% indicate the launch location, sketch the ascent profile, estimate
%% the maximum launch loads and the required minimum longitudinal and
%% transversal natural frequencies, and identify the payload adapters
%% available for use and their characteristics.

%% E. Based on the information obtained from the previous Tasks,
%% generate a detailed mission profile and a rough timeline for the
%% mission.

\subworkpkg{1.4}

%% Tasks

%% A. Using methods based on statistical data and/or empirical
%% relationships (like, for instance, the ones presented in Refs. [1]
%% and [2]), define the preliminary mass and power budgets for the
%% spacecraft, i.e.  the mass and power distribution among all the
%% relevant subsystems. Pay particular attention to the definition of
%% proper design margins in your budgets.

%% least three different preliminary architectures of the spacecraft
%% with its main components (e.g. antennae, solar arrays, batteries,
%% nuclear generator, payload units, external skin). Draft at least
%% one of these preliminary sketches as a CATIA drawing.
