%% Tasks

%% A. Using methods based on statistical data and/or empirical
%% relationships (like, for instance, the ones presented in Refs. [1]
%% and [2]), define the preliminary mass and power budgets for the
%% spacecraft, i.e.  the mass and power distribution among all the
%% relevant subsystems. Pay particular attention to the definition of
%% proper design margins in your budgets.

%% B. Based on the information gathered so far, roughly sketch at
%% least three different preliminary architectures of the spacecraft
%% with its main components (e.g. antennae, solar arrays, batteries,
%% nuclear generator, payload units, external skin). Draft at least
%% one of these preliminary sketches as a CATIA drawing.

%% C. For each one of the proposed preliminary architectures, estimate
%% the vehicle MMOI (Mass Moment of Inertia) both for the deployed and
%% un-deployed state.  Deliverables

The first optional design was a circular satellite with a radius of
\SI{3.5}{m} and a height of \SI{4}{m} as seen in
figure \ref{sketch1}. On the bottom side of the satellite, the main
thruster and the payload are attached. This is because the payload
only needs to work when the thruster is turned of. On the top side of
the satellite, the location of the communication antennae is indicated
with a triangle. For this configuration, a nuclear power system is
used that is indicated with balloon 1. this will tilt outwards when
the satellite is being deployed. This is because the nuclear power
unit produces a lot of heat.

\end{figure}

A next possible configuration is a cuboid with
dimensions \SI{2.5}{m}, \SI{3.5}{m}, and \SI{4.4}{m}. The undeployed
state can be seen in figure \ref{sketch2}. On the bottom view, the
thruster and the payload are attached. with the payload indicated as
balloon 1 and the thruster as balloon 2. On the side view the
undeployed solar panels are visible. On the top view is the location
of the antennae indicated with a triangle.

\end{figure}

The deployed state can be seen in figures \ref{sketch3} and
\ref{sketch3-1}. The difference is that the folded solar panels are
now unfolded. From the reference data it was found a solar panel area
of \SI{60}{m^2} is needed. This results in 12 panels with dimensions
$\SI{3}{m}\cdot\SI{3.33}{m}$ equally distributed over the two sides.

%% D1.4.4. Estimation of the vehicle MMOI in the deployed and
%% un-deployed state.

\deliverable{1.4.4}

In this section the Mass moments of Inertia of the different sketches
will be estimated.

%%maybe subsection

The first estimation will be about the cylindrical shape. The MMOI in
the direction of the height can be calculated by formula
\ref{MMOIcyl1}.

\begin{equation}
  \label{MMOIcyl1}
  \mathrm{MMOI}=\frac{1}{2}mr^2
\end{equation}
Every variable in this equation is known. the mass is \SI{3000}{kg},
the radius is \SI{1.75}{m}. This gives a MMOI of \SI{6000}{kgm^2}. The
MMOI on the other 2 axis is equal and can be calculated by using
formula \ref{MMOIcyl2}.

\begin{equation}
  \label{MMOIcyl2}
  \mathrm{MMOI}=\frac{1}{12}m(3r^2+l^2)
\end{equation}
Because the height of the satellite is also a known value, this can
also be found.  The MMOI is \SI{5286}{kgm^2}. Because the undeployed
state looks almost the same as the deployed state, the MMOI will not
change much if the satellite is deployed.

%%maybe add a subsection

For the MMOI of the cuboid perpendicular on the exhaust, formula
\ref{perpex} is used

\begin{equation}
  \label{perpex}
  \mathrm{MMOI}=\frac{1}{12}m(2.5^2+3.5^2)
\end{equation}
this gives a value of \SI{4625}{kgm^2}.

For the MMOI parallel to the side of length $3.5m$ formula \ref{mmoi35}

\begin{equation}
  \label{mmoi35}
  \mathrm{MMOI}=\frac{1}{12}m(2.5^2+4.4^2)
\end{equation}
This gives a MMOI of \SI{6400}{kgm^2}.

The MMOI parallel with the side of length \SI{2.5}{m} is calculated by
formula \ref{mmoi25}

\begin{equation}
  \label{mmoi25}
  \mathrm{MMOI}=\frac{1}{12}m(3.5^2+4.4^2)
\end{equation}
For this one, the MMOI is \SI{7900}{kgm^2}.

For the deployed MMOI of the cuboid shaped satellite, there are some
estimations needed for the solar panels. For these estimations, a
specific power is needed. This is \SI{25}{W/kg} for standard solar
panels. \cite{wertz1999space}

%% this citation is from the smad book
The solar array mass is then calculated by formula \ref{SpecificPower}

\begin{equation}
  \label{SpecificPower}
  M_a=\frac{P}{P_{sp}}=0.04*P
\end{equation}
This gives a solar array mass of \SI{19.4}{kg}.

Another needed value is the area offset. This is calculated by formula \ref{AreaOffset}

\begin{equation}
  \label{AreaOffset}
  L_a=\frac{3}{2}L+\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{A_a}{2} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}

In formula \ref{AreaOffset} the L is the distance between the solar
arrays and the $A_a$ is the array surface. These are respectively
\SI{2.5}{m} and \SI{60}{m^2}. If those two values are inserted, an
area offset of $6.489 m$ is found. With these 2 values, the MMOI
caused by the solar panels can be calculated.

To clearify the axis sytem, it is shown in figure
\ref{axissystemcuboid}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{axissystem}
  \caption{axis sytem for calculating MMOI}
  \label{axissystemcuboid}
\end{figure}

For the MMOI perpendicular to the solar panel face, formula
\ref{mmoix} is used.

\begin{equation}
  \label{mmoix}
  \mathrm{MMOI}_x=\left(L_a^2+\frac{A_a}{12}\right)M_a
\end{equation}

This results in a moment of inertia of \SI{914}{kgm^2}.  For the MMOI
over the y-axis, formula \ref{mmoiy} is used.

\begin{equation}
  \label{mmoiy}
  \mathrm{MMOI}_y=\left(L_a^2+\frac{A_a}{24}\right)M_a
\end{equation}

This gives an MMOI of \SI{865}{kgm^2}.  For the MMOI around the
a-axis, formula \ref{mmoia} is used.

\begin{equation}
  \label{mmoia}
  \mathrm{MMOI}_a=\left(\frac{A_a}{24}\right)M_a
\end{equation}

Which gives a MMOI of \SI{49}{kgm^2}.
