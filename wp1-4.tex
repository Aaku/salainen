%% Tasks

%% A. Using methods based on statistical data and/or empirical
%% relationships (like, for instance, the ones presented in Refs. [1]
%% and [2]), define the preliminary mass and power budgets for the
%% spacecraft, i.e.  the mass and power distribution among all the
%% relevant subsystems. Pay particular attention to the definition of
%% proper design margins in your budgets.

%% B. Based on the information gathered so far, roughly sketch at
%% least three different preliminary architectures of the spacecraft
%% with its main components (e.g. antennae, solar arrays, batteries,
%% nuclear generator, payload units, external skin). Draft at least
%% one of these preliminary sketches as a CATIA drawing.

%% C. For each one of the proposed preliminary architectures, estimate
%% the vehicle MMOI (Mass Moment of Inertia) both for the deployed and
%% un-deployed state.  Deliverables

%% D1.4.1. Tables showing the preliminary mass and power budgets for
%% the spacecraft.
